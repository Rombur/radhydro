\chapter{Equations}
In this section, we will develop the equations for radiation hydrodynamics and
their discretization.
\section{Hydrodynamic}
First, we start with hydrodynamic equations.
\subsection{Continuous equations}
We want to solve the Euler equations:
\begin{align}
  &\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \bn (\rho \bs{u}) = 0 \label{mass},\\
  &\frac{\partial \rho \bs{u}}{\partial t} + \bn (\rho\bs{u}\bs{u}) + \bn p =
  F \label{momentum},\\
  &\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\(\rho e +\frac{1}{2}\rho u^2\) +
  \bn\(\rho\bs{u}e + \frac{1}{2}\rho \bs{u} u^2+p\bs{u}\) = \rho q +\bs{u}F
  \label{energy},
\end{align}
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\rho$ is the density,
  \item $t$ is the time,
  \item $\bs{u}$ is the speed,
  \item $\bs{u}\bs{u}$ is a tensor, the divergence is taken by assigning first
  1 to the second index, and forming the ordinary divergence of
  $\rho\bs{u}u_1$, then repeating for index 2 and index 3,
  \item $p$ is the pressure,
  \item $F$ is a body force,
  \item $e$ is the internal energy,
  \item $q$ is an external source of heat.
\end{itemize}
\Cref{mass} is the mass conservation equation, \cref{momentum} is the momentum
conservation equation, and \cref{energy} is the energy conservation equation.
The Euler equations describe an ideal fluid, i.e. with no viscosity and no heat
conduction. These equations allow shocks.
\subsection{Discretization}
Major discretizations:
\begin{description}
  \item[Lagrangian:] the mesh follows the material. This is very efficient in
  one dimension but for multidimensional problems, the mesh can be too
  distorted and new it is necessary to remesh the domain.
  \item[Eulerian:] the mesh is fixed at the beginning of the calculation.
  Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) is often necessary to have an accurate
  results.
  \item[Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE):] the mesh moves at a given speed.
  \item[Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH):] there is no mesh. SPH looks
  like a Monte-Carlo method but initial particles are not selected randomly.
  The method is first order.
\end{description}
In the rest of this paper, we will focus on Eulerian discretization.
\subsubsection{Lagrangian plus advection}
A time step consists of a ''Lagrangian'' step followed by an advection step.
The idea is the same than operator split: for each of these substeps just part
of the expression for the time derivative of each  is applied. The unknowns
$\rho$, $\rho\bs{u}$, and $\rho e$ are updated using those parts of their time
derivatives, and the updated values are the starting point for the next
partial time step. For the Lagrangian step the density is left alone, the
momentum density is updated using just the pressure gradient, after which a
new flow velocity is calculated by division. The velocity and momentum density
components are centered in time at $t_{n+1/2}$. The new velocities are used to
calculated $\bn\bs{u}$ and the internal energy density is updated using just
the first term on the right-hand side of \cref{3.22}. That completes the
Lagrangian step.

Equations for the Lagrangian step:
\begin{align}
  &\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = -\bn (\rho \bs{u}),\\
  &\frac{\partial \rho \bs{u}}{\partial t} = -\bn p - \bn(\rho
  \bs{u}\bs{u}),\\
  &\frac{\partial \rho e}{\partial t} = -p\bn\bs{u} - \bn (\rho e \bs{u})
  \label{3.22}.
\end{align}
Equations for the advection step:
\begin{align}
  &\frac{d}{dt}(\rho V) = -\int_S \rho \bs{u}d\br,
  &\frac{d}{dt}(\rho \bs{u}V') = -\int_{S'} \rho \bs{u}\bs{u} d\br,
  &\frac{d}{dt}(\rho e V) = -\int_S \rho \bs{u}e d\br.
\end{align}
$V$ is a zonal volume and $V'$ is a dual zone volume, since the velocity
components are staggered in space from the quantities like density and
internal energy. The surface $S$ and $S'$ represent the boundaries of $V$ and
$V'$.
\subsubsection{Godunov's methods}
Godunov's methods are finite-volume methods. First, we write the Euler
equations as:
\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial U}{\partial t} + \bn \bs{F}(U)=0.
\end{equation}
The vector $U$ contains the conserved densities $\rho$, $\rho u_x$, $\rho
u_y$, and $\rho e + \rho u^2/2$. The components of the flux vector are $\rho
\bs{u}$, $\rho \bs{u}u_x+ p\bs{e}_x$, $\rho \bs{u} u_y+p\bs{e}_y$, and $\rho
\bs{u} e +\rho \bs{u} u^2/2+p\bs{u}$. By averaging over a volume $V$ and over
a time interval $[t_n,t_{n+1}]$, we get:
\begin{equation}
  V\frac{\Delta \la U\ra}{\Delta t} = -\int_S\la \bs{F} \ra \cdot \bs{n} d\br.
\end{equation}
